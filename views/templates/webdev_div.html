    <p>I built lessonwell to make my life easier as a teacher. What I learned from qCalculus (and a couple mini-projects afterwards) I rolled into lessonwell. This is my first attempt to incorporate an ecommerce api (stripe), my first use of GAE's NDB database, and my first incorporation of Bootstrap 3</p>

    <p>My second attempt at a public web-app during a period where I was just getting into photography. My brother turned me onto Kiln, which was my first foray into version control (enjoy my angry commit messages, I don't think I knew what I was doing then...)</p>

    <p>qCalculus was my very first webapp after completing the Udacity web-development course. You can see the influence of the Udacity interface in my design. Apparently, I had no idea what version control was back then, and all my "commits" were just saves to a Dropbox folder!</p>
