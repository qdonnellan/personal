#Apps I use on a Daily Basis, Developer Edition

Yesterday I posted a list of simple web apps I use in my daily life as a Calculus/Engineering teacher. Here are the apps I use on a regular basis in my role as a Python web developer:

## Sublime
[sublimetext.com](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

When I first got into software development, I searched around for recommended editors and quickly came across Sublime; I have not used any editor since! You can "trial" Sublime indefinitely for free, but you really should pay to register since it is such an awesome product.

## FreeMind
[freemind.sourceforge.net](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)

Free Mind is a free *mind mapping* platform which I use to keep track of tasks I need to complete and tasks I have already completed. Because it is a mind map, this is an excellent way for me to visualize the projects I'm working on: what is consuming my time, what I need to spend more time on, which projects have the most depth, etc. If you are a visual person, I strongly recommend taking a look at FreeMind.

## SourceTree
[sourcetreeapp.com](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

I have several mercurial and git projects on Kiln and Github; SourceTree allows me to handle all my commits from one app. My favorite feature about source tree is that I can make several changes to many different files, but only include a select amount of those changes on individual commits. If you haven't used SourceTree yet, you should definitely check it out. 

## Stripe
[stripe.com](https://stripe.com/)

I use stripe to handle all my user's subscriptions on [lessonwell](http://www.lessonwell.com). You'd be hard-pressed to find a better (or simpler) Python API for a payment service than Stripe's. I check the Stripe dashboard on a daily basis, and they've recently added the feature of checking multiple accounts from the same dashboard. I actually find myself on the Stripe dashboard more frequently than the Google Analytics dashboard - that should say enough!
