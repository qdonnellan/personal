Last year [Jennifer Isgitt](http://empathicteacher.com/), our school's AP English Literature teacher, and myself submitted an entry to the English Journal for their January Issue on "Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning in Collaboration". We wrote about our exchange of ideas as we've been building discussion-based classroom in our respective subjects. 

The experience was tremendously rewarding, but to have our script published is very cool. Check it out: [The English Journal](http://www.ncte.org/journals/ej/issues/v103-3)
