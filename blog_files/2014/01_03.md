title_ 10 Posts in 10 Days
*January 3, 2014*

Over the last several years I've tried out several different blog platforms from blogger, Jux, wordpress, and I've even built my own site here to hold my blog posts. At each stop I've struggled to populate my blog with content. I've failed to realize that, while hopping from platform to platform hoping that with each new one I start I'll magically populate it with insightful things, I never addressed the fact that I just am very, very bad at maintaining a blog. 

So with the new year I'm going to try a simple procedure to kickstart this blogging habit: write a new blog post everyday for 10 days. When the tenth day has come and gone and 10 blog posts are in the books, I'll make a new goal. 

In the spirit of starting off small and taking baby steps, this most definitely counts as post #1.
