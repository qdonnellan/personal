title_ Python Unit Testing For Beginners, From A Beginner
#### Post #4 in the series [10 Posts in 10 Days](http://www.qdonnellan.com/blog/2014/01/03)
*January 6, 2014*

Yesterday I [wrote about](http://www.qdonnellan.com/blog/2014/01/05) how I had finally figured out how to incorporate testing into my habits as a programmer. Today I wanted to take some time and share with other Python novices the habit I've actually formed in hopes that this will be useful to someone out there who struggled to get started with testing as I did.

## Before you start
Before we begin, let's make sure your computer is ready to do testing. Python already has the unittest module builtin, which I'll be using to write my tests. You will also need to install **nose** which makes *running* your tests from the command-line super easy (I've also encountered the notion that nose makes other things super easy in the future as well, perhaps I'll discover those in the future and write another blog posts about it at that time...)

*Note: I'm writing this tutorial for folks on Mac/Linux systems, if you are on a Windows computer, the command-line stuff may look a bit strange, but the actual python code should be identical. I'll leave it to you to figure out the Windows command line voodoo.*

**Step 1:** Open a terminal and type:

    pip install nose

That's it! If you encounter errors, please refer to [the official nosetests docs](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

## The Scenario
Now that we have the basics taken care of, let's imagine that you are tasked with something simple (if ridiculous): 

> Write a function that accepts string as an input, replaces every instance of "the" with "HAHA" (if there are any) and then returns the string. 

## The Working Directory
Let's assume that we're going to be putting our code in a folder named **haha\_replace**. Inside that folder I want you to create two python files and name them: **haha\_replace.py** and **haha\_replace_test.py**

Our directory structure should look like:

    haha_replace
    -- haha_replace.py
    -- haha_replace_test.py

> Note: my habit is to write a `_test.py` file for every `.py` file I write, with the same name as the file prepended to `_test.py`. 

## Write the tests first!
This is was the strangest thing to get used to: you should write your tests *before* you write your functional code. That way, you have a framework for knowing exactly what should be done. 

So, let's open the file `haha_replace_test.py` and type the following

    import unittest
    from haha_replace import haha_replace_function

    class test_implementation_of_haha_replace_function(unittest.TestCase):

      def test_simple_case(self):
        '''
        test that a sentence with "the" gets it replaced with "HAHA"
        '''
        sentence = "the world is dark"
        expected = "HAHA world is dark"
        self.assertEqual(haha_replace_function(sentence), expected)

### What did we just type?

    import unittest

This imports the unittest module which is included with Python

    from haha_replace import haha_replace_function

Here you are telling your test file to import the function `haha_replace_function` from the `haha_replace` file. This function doesn't exist yet because we haven't written anything inside that file yet! No worries, we'll get there in a seccond.

    class test_implementation_of_haha_replace_function(unittest.TestCase):

Here we are creating your test case class. The name you pick is arbitrary, though my habit is to start each test case with the prefix `test_`

    def test_simple_case(self):

Here we define the first test we want to run, and we're going to call it `test_simple_case` and it inherits the properties of the class. Below that we write our docstring:

    '''
    test that a sentence with "the" gets it replaces with "HAHA"
    '''

The docstring is important for our sanity: you should always write our in sentence form what you want (or expect) your functions to do, this makes debugging easier. Nose will also print out the description of each test that fails from the docstring of that tests.

    sentence = "the world is dark"
    expected = "HAHA world is dark"
    self.assertEqual(haha_replace_function(sentence), expected)

This is the heart of our tests. Remember, we have not written the `haha_replace_funciton` yet! But with this line of code, we are asserting what that function *should do* if it is working correctly. Notice that we created an example sentence, and we hard-coded what we expect the result to be. At the very least, this is what our function should be able to do, so this is a good test. 

## Run the test
Now, let's run the test. We know it's going to fail because we haven't even written the function yet. To run the test, go to the command line and navigate to our working directory

    cd /haha_replace

Or, wherever you put your code. Then, run nose by simply typing into the command line:

    nosetests

You should see some output similar to:

    ======================================================================
    ERROR: Failure: ImportError (cannot import name haha_replace_function)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose/loader.py", line 413, in loadTestsFromName
        addr.filename, addr.module)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose/importer.py", line 47, in importFromPath
        return self.importFromDir(dir_path, fqname)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nose/importer.py", line 94, in importFromDir
        mod = load_module(part_fqname, fh, filename, desc)
      File "/Users/quentin/GitHub/random_questions/questions/arrays_and_strings/strings/haha_replace_test.py", line 2, in <module>
        from haha_replace import haha_replace_function
    ImportError: cannot import name haha_replace_function


Hey, we knew this was going to happen - our test is trying to import the `haha_replace_function`, but it doesn't even exist! So that's the first thing we should do, make it exist. 

> Note, this is how **test driven development** works: you write a test before you write any functional code. Then, you run the tests and write code until you tests pass. 

## Write the functional code
Now, let's open up the `haha_replace` file and type this:

    def haha_replace_function(sentence):
      '''
      takes in a sentence, replaces any instance of "the" with "HAHA", returns sentence
      '''
      return sentence

I've written our function, a docstring which gives it a description, and a simple return statement. No where does this function replace "the" with "HAHA", so if we run our tests it should fail. Let's try it

    nosetests

    ======================================================================
    FAIL: test that a sentence with "the" gets it replaced with "HAHA"
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/quentin/GitHub/random_questions/questions/arrays_and_strings/strings/haha_replace_test.py", line 12, in test_simple_case
        self.assertEqual(haha_replace_function(sentence), expected)
    AssertionError: 'the world is dark' != 'HAHA world is dark'

Nice, Nose detected that our test failed! Notice that it printed out the docstring of our test function:

    ======================================================================
    FAIL: test that a sentence with "the" gets it replaced with "HAHA"
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hopefully, you should see the importance of writing good docstrings for your tests!

## Fix the code
Let's fix the code so that it actually works as expected:

    def haha_replace_function(sentence):
      '''
      takes in a sentence, replaces any instance of "the" with "HAHA", returns sentence
      '''
      sentence = sentence.replace("the", "HAHA")
      return sentence

Now run `nosetests` and everything should be OK. 

## Write more tests
At this point, you could write more tests to make sure your code works for any possible case. For example, you may wish to check that a sentence with no "the" returns the same thing:

    import unittest
    from haha_replace import haha_replace_function

    class test_implementation_of_haha_replace_function(unittest.TestCase):

      def test_simple_case(self):
        '''
        test that a sentence with "the" gets it replaced with "HAHA"
        '''
        sentence = "the world is dark"
        expected = "HAHA world is dark"
        self.assertEqual(haha_replace_function(sentence), expected)

      def test_sentence_with_no_the(self):
        '''
        test that a sentence with no "the" gets nothing replaced
        '''
        sentence = "hello world"
        self.assertEqual(haha_replace_function(sentence), sentence)


Now when you run `nosetests` from the command line, you should see that it Ran 2 tests OK. 

With this in mind, it should be easy to start writing more tests for your functions.

## Summary
1. Use **Nose**
2. Write a test before you write your function. 
3. Then, write your function. 
4. Fix your function if your tests fail. 
5. Come up with more useful tests and make sure your function passes.
